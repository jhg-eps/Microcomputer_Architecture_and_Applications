Lab 10 README

In this laboratory procedure, I used the TIM4 IRQ Handler in conjunction with the sine function to do DAC (in the form of creating a 
440Hz sine wave). The sine function was used to determine the quadrant and sign of a particular angle (held in R1). From there, the 
voltage variable (held in R0) was subtracted from the maximum of the DOR register (4096) in order to create an instantaneous voltage
value between 0V and 3.3V which were output to the two DAC converters simultaneously.
