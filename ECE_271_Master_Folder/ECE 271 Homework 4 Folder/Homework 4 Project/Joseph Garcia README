In this lab, I used interrupts to toggle the Blue LED (PB6). The application works this way: by pressing the User Button
(which is mapped to PA0), the EXTI0_IRQHandler is called by the EXTI0 Interrupt. If the EXTI->PR bit is 1, then we have the "selected 
trigger request occurred" so we go into the light toggling routine. With the EOR command, we are able to turn the light off if it was on,
and we can turn it off if it was on already.
