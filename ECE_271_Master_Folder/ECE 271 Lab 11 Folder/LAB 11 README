Lab 11 README

In this lab procedure, I used the SysTick and TIM4 timers to play music. Using 60 BPM as a reference, my SysTick delay was set to generate an
interrupt every 1 millisecond. Using particular note frequencies (array index values) and their associated beat counts as I stepped through 
the note and beat count arrays, I made sure that the SysTick interrupt made each note last the proper amount of time and that the TIM4 IRQ 
Handler was generating the proper frequency of wave (based on what index I was on in the note array). My something cool was to write and play 
the Excitebike theme (intro) song.
