Joseph Garcia Project Report and README

In this lab, I used the SysTick Timer and the SysTick_Handler in combination to cause the Blue and Green LEDs to blink on the board. 
While the SysTick Timer was counting down freely, decrementing the time delay constant by one millisecond each time that it (SysTick timer) 
reached zero in the SysTick Handler, there was a busy loop (in the delay_function function) comparing the time delay constant to zero. Once the
SysTick Handler had decremented the time delay variable 1000 times (and this took 1000 ms = 1 second), the busy loop could quit and the 
lights could be toggled the opposite way for another 1000 ms. Thus we get our blinking.
