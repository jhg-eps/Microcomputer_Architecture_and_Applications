In this lab, I used Pulse Width Modulation to dim and brighten the Blue (PB6) and Green (PB7) LEDs in an
infinite loop. My cool thing was to have the lights dimming and brightening 180 degrees out of phase, so 
as the light fled from 1, it could flow into the other. This could have been achieved by using a for loop in 
which both lights were using PWM 1 but the directions of the two LEDs were opposite so that one was 
counting up and the other down, but the most simple way to do this is to just have one of the LEDs use
PWM Mode 2 for the same effect.

PWM Report:

TIM4_ARR: 240
TIM4_PSC: 1

			TIM4_CCR1		Pulse Width				Pulse Period
Case 1:		40				191.4 microseconds  	229.5 microseconds
Case 2:		80				153.4 microseconds		229.5 microseconds
Case 3:		120				115.2 microseconds		229.5 microseconds

Question 1:   The relationship: (system clock/(prescaler)aka PSC)= CK_CNT = (1/Pulse Period)

Case 1 Duty: 83.4%
Case 2 Duty: 66.8%
Case 3 Duty: 50.22%
